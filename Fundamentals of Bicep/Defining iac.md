**Infrastructure as Code**Â automates and standardizes infrastructure setup using code, making deployments consistent and repeatable.

## Defining infrastructure as code

You can think of infrastructure as code as being like the instruction manual for your infrastructure. The manual details the end configuration of your resources and how to reach that configuration state.

Infrastructure as code is the process of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">automating your infrastructure provisioning</mark>. It uses a descriptive coding language an versioning system that's similar to what's used for source code. When you create an application, your source code each time you compile it. In a similar manner, infrastructure-as-code deployments are automated, consistent, and repeatable. Infrastructure as code can automate the deployments of your infrastructure resources, like virtual networks, virtual machines, applications, and storage.
