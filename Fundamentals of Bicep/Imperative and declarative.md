## Imperative and declarative code

You can write an instruction manual for new toy assembly in different ways. When you automate the deployment of services and infrastructure, you can take two approaches: imperative and declarative.

- With <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">imperative code</mark> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">you execute a sequence of commands</mark>, in a specific order, to reach an end configuration. This process defines what the code should accomplish, and it defines how to accomplish the task. The imperative approach is like a step-by-step instruction manual.
- With _declarative code_, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">you specify only the end configuration</mark>. The code doesn't define how to accomplish the task. The declarative approach is like the exploded view instruction manual.

When you choose between using an imperative approach and a declarative approach to resource provisioning, consider the tools that might already be in use in your organization. Also consider which approach might match your own skills.
